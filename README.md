# AutomaticFolderCleaner

Imagine a situation like this:You have a folder containing files of multiple types like txt, mp3 etc. You decide to clean up this mess and organize them in a way that images are in one folder and songs in another. Will you be moving them as per file type, i.e. number of moves = number of files . No, Iâ€™ll not be doing this :).
This task could be automated by writing this python script which can automatically create a separate directory and move files in their respective destinations.
